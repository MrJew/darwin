\title{Darwin: A Genetic Programming Framework for Cloning Web Services}
\author{George Kouzmov}
\date{31 January 2014}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Web services have become a common way of communicating between devices. With the growth of the
world wide web there are thousands software projects using webservices to exchange information.

Genetic programming is a branch of artificial intelligence inspired by biological evolution. Its creating a program that modifies programs.
It uses an evolutionary algorithm based methodology to iterate through individuals(programs) and captures the best performing ones.
The result of a genetic program is a heuristic, a stochastic method - no guarantee of success.

The project aims to prove that genetic programming can be used for cloning web services. It focuses
on creating a user centric framework. Cloning is done through reverse engineering the functionality using the primitive set of the genetic program.
 One of many applications of cloned web services is software redundancy
also known as N-version programming, that can increase the reliability of a system.
The Darwin framework proves that such use of genetic programming is possible.

This is an innovative project, there are no prior attempts to use genetic programming to clone
web services. Hopefully it would create a base for future development in the area.

\section{Requirements Gathering}
After creating project management environment and clarifying genetic programming concepts it was possible to specify the requirements.
There were pre-set by the client, however with time they iterated and new ones were introduced. Requirements were key to establishing
the same goal both for me and the client.

\section{Future Development}
Since the beginning of the project the development has been very ambitious and all
the goals that were set were accomplished. This gave the opportunity to think a lot about
improvements for the framework - anything from re-factoring, improving features to adding
additional functionality.
