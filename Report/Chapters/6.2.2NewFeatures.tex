\textbf{Improvement of web services} - improving web service performance using the framework was an initial requirement
in the project but due to complexity and time issues it was opt-out from the project. The concept can still be implemented
and used for improving current web services that the developer has created so improved web service can be compared by performance
speed, memory usage and stability to the target one. After a certain threshold of improvement is reached there can be automatic deployment
of the generated improved web service.

\textbf{Using unit tests as fitness} - a way of measuring fitness can be a set of unit tests the individual needs to pass. This way
individual can be tested if certain functionality exists and hence force the genetic program to evolve towards an individual with
the required functionality. From that point a dynamic addition of unit tests can be included so functionality can be introduced through
the evolution of a program. Comparing it to biological evolution its like adding a new threat for an organism in its environment hence
the organism needs to adapt.
