A key part of the project was organization and project management. With a complex project like this there were many
factors and issues that needed to be considered before development could start. Research had to be done to identify
other similar projects like the \textit{Gen-o-fix: an embeddable framework for dynamic adaptive genetic improvement programming}.
Technologies had to be considered since multiple approaches to the implementation were available. Frequent meetings and 
iterations over requirements were key so the goals can be identified. Software development methods like agile development had to be used to help structure the
project, focus on the key goals and important features so sprints can be set up and development can start.
