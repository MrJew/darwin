A key part of the project was organization and project management. There were many
factors and issues that needed to be considered before development could start. Research had to be done to identify
other similar projects such as \textit{Gen-o-fix: an embeddable framework for dynamic adaptive genetic improvement programming}\cite{genofix}.
Technologies had to be considered since multiple approaches to the implementation were available. Frequent meetings and 
iterations over requirements were key so the goals could be identified. Software development methods including agile development had to be used to help structure the
project, focus on the key goals and important features so sprints could be set up and development could be as efficient as possible.
