It has been a great journey developing this project and one that will hopefully continue further. Since the
beginning there have been many difficulties with the project mostly related with the meta-programming field
it's focused on. Finding sources and doing research has been problematic because development in the field  of genetic programming 
isn't on the same scale as other more popular fields in programming (e.g Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence).
However the result from the project has motived me to continue explore genetic programming even more and expand the
framework.
