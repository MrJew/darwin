During the first months of the project a lot of time was spend developing small components and testing
the technologies. This created the base for productive sprints. There were difficulties in the implementation
however the time spent testing out the technologies proved very useful in solving the problems quickly. The agile
development proved very successful for implementing step by step the functionalities of the project. Following
the architecture design strictly helped when modifications of components were done.
