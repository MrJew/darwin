The aim of the project was to develop a tool that uses genetic programming for cloning web services. After
three sprints of development, system and usability testing, the project was a success. The tool was successful
in satisfying the clients requirements and in cloning part of WolframAlpha's functionality. It managed to create a base
for further development in the area. Hopefully Darwin will be 
used by the genetic programming community and help genetic programming projects in the university.
