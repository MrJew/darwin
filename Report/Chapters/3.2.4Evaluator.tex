The final big component is the \textit{Evaluator} \ref{fig:classd}. It is a CherryPy service that can be executed on any machine running python and
 has only one method - evaluate. It takes an individual, test arguments in the form of a dictionary and  fitness
results evaluates the individual compares with the fitness function and return the result. Initially the individual was in a DEAP
represented form however that meant that in order to evaluate it the same DEAP configuration needed to be set up on the evaluating side as on the client one.
This was impractical,slower, it was introducing many dependencies and much harder to set up. The Evaluator needs
to be easy to set up, easy to modify because it is expected to be ran on multiple machines including RaspberryPis.
Because of that the individuals was later represented as source code which meant it was able to run on any machine
that runs python. This way simplicity was achieved for this component by moving most of the overhead work to the client.
