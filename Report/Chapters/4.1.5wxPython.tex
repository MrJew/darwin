WxPython follows the standard graphical library design pattern -MVC (Model View Controller).
 This design is focused on separation of concerns making it perfect for building a GUI for creation of XML files. The model or the 
data is the configuration parameters used, the view is the wxPython's frame and interface and the controller is the XML parser making use of data.

The library provides an easy to understand and use API. The main component is a frame, each secondary component like a pane, button or a menubar
is added to it. The framework uses different types of sizers to organize the components in the frame. To create more complex layouts
sizers can be stacked. WxPython has a large number of pre-set and easy to configure dialogue boxes for almost any case that might be needed.
More complex components were later created because of framework's versatility and modularity.





The main challenges in creating the GUI wasn't creating the functionality and linking it to the graphical interface but making
the interface user friendly
