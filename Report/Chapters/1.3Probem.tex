The purpose of the project is to develop a framework that can reverse engineer a web service.
Theoretically it is possible to complete this through genetic programming. Initially the project
was separated into three steps - evaluate individuals over a network, clone and existing web service and improve a
web service, however the third step was changed to creating a graphical user interface(GUI). The project aims to clone an external web services and provide a GUI to
generate the configuration files needed for the framework to work.
\paragraph{}
When using an external web service we know the parameters we are giving to it, we have an idea of the way it 
works and we know the results. Combining this knowledge meant it was possible to use an external web service as the target expression in
the function. After part two of the project
was completed it was proved that it is possible to clone the functionality of a web service. Because it is a proof of concept
project a simple web service was used in order to verify the expected result. However the project provides evidence that with the right
choice of primitive set it is possible to clone the functionality of even more complex web services.
