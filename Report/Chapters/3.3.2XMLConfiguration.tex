The XML file that is parsed between the GUI and the framework needed to be readable and editable by users. That meant that the
markup used had to follow standard design so it can be modified by users.
This design provided a backup plan in case GUI implementation failed. However the GUI was created
which meant a parser needed to be implemented which was done with the help of \textit{lxml} library.
