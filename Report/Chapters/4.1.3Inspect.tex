Inspect is a python library for getting information from live objects (e.g. modules, classes, methods, functions, tracebacks, frame objects, code objects).
This is the primary tool used for automating the Darwin framework and the main tool used in code generation as well. The inspect library provides multiple
functions for gathering information about live objects. In the case of Darwin functions, methods and arguments were the inspected live objects from which the source
code, the signature or variable information was extracted.
