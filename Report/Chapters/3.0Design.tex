When designing the framework the idea behind it was to provide a simple way to control the key parameters in a genetic program.
Since the beginning of the project we were aware of the scope of the project and the complexity it can reach so another key
design feature was modularity. Component based software engineering practices were used throughout the project,
helping to organize the multiple technologies used in the project.
