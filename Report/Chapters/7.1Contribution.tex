I would like to thank David White for supervising the project and helping with building
the requirements and successfully introducing me to the field of genetic programming. Many 
thanks to the DEAP developers Félix-Antoine Fortin, Marc-André Gardner and François-Michel De Rainville
who helped me with understanding and modifying the DEAP framework.
