Among the key issues in the development was combining all the technologies used in the project. A genetic programming framework, REST based
web service, an XML parser, a GUI, code inspection and generation libraries; each was needed in order to create a framework that can clone
web services. For each component that was needed there were multiple options available so the best ones needed to be chosen which meant
trying out pack of frameworks and libraries.
